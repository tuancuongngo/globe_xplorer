# Globe Xplorer: A MERN Stack Travel Web App
A travel web application built using the MERN stack that lets users add pins on a 3D model of the Earth to review places they have been to. This app also features user creation, authentication, and authorization.

The Mapbox API has been used to render the 3D model of the Earth as the map, and users can easily interact with the map to add and view the pins.

### Features
- Users can create accounts and log in securely.
- Users can add pins to the map to review places they have visited.
- Users can view other users' pins and reviews.
- The app features real-time updates, so changes made by one user are immediately visible to others.

### Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
